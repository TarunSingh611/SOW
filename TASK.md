The tasks to do is:
1. A copy of this URL: https://online.123fakturera.se/terms/
2. A very simple pricelist.

The SOW shall work on both mobile portrait, landscape, tablet and desktop resolution.


Regarding:
https://online.123fakturera.se/terms/

This URLs should look and function as it does today.

It should have the same look and scroll, click and touch behaviour in all browsers.

The texts (English + Swedish) should be pulled from a pgsql db that you design. 

Hamburger menu should work.

For the background image and the logo and the flag, you can link to its storage in the existing solution:

Regarding:
Pricelist

It should look as in the pictures.

Here we will ignore almost all functionality, like adding products, deleting.

The design only shows one product line, but please add at least 20 so we can test the scrolling functionality.

The headers should be the same as we use, but feel free to use your own icons.

The data should be pulled from a pgsql db that you design.

The fields like Product/Service, In Price, Price and so on should be populated with data pulled from backend.

The fields should not be locked â€“ so we should be able to enter test data into them that should save to the db.

Tablet, landscape and portrait will not show the same fields as desktop.

(Hamburger menu does not need to work for this URL.)


Framework:
Frontend shall be developed in vite.js (or in React.js alone.) Next.js shall not be used.

Styling should be plain (vanilla) css.

Backend should ideally be in Fasitfy and sequlize but other node.js frameworks can be used.

Language should be JS


Except for this I give you free hands to develop as you think is best : )


Your mini app should be published on one of the free providers.


The code should be on for example gitlab for us to look at.


When you are finished so we can test it please provide a detailed list of what you have used detailing all things, like which React version, version of js, css, libraries and so on.


Please confirm if you are going to do the SOW or if I should remove you from my shortlist.

Any questions?

Kind Regards
Emanuel
